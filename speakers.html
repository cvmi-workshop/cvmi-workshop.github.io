		<strong> Abstract:</strong> Cell images contain a vast amount of quantifiable information about the status of the cell: for example, whether it is diseased, whether it is responding to a drug treatment, or whether a pathway has been disrupted by a genetic mutation. We extract hundreds of features of cells from images. Just like transcriptional profiling, the similarities and differences in the patterns of extracted features reveal connections among diseases, drugs, and genes. Improving this pipeline is an active area of research, from feature extraction to batch correction to quality control to assessing similarities.

We are harvesting similarities in image-based profiles to identify, at a single-cell level, how diseases, drugs, and genes affect cells, which can uncover small molecules’ mechanism of action, discover gene functions, predict assay outcomes, discover disease-associated phenotypes, identify the functional impact of disease-associated alleles, and find novel therapeutic candidates. As part of the JUMP-Cell Painting Consortium (Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling-Cell Painting) we are aiming to establish experimental and computational best practices for image-based profiling (https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/results) and produce the world’s largest public Cell Painting gene/compound image resource, with 140,000 perturbations in five replicates, to be released November 2022. With these data and new technologies like Pooled Cell Painting and variants of the assay like LipocyteProfiler and CardioProfiler, we hope to bring drug discovery-accelerating applications to practice.

 	  	<strong> Abstract:</strong> Deep learning has enabled sophisticated AI analysis of radiology images, including CT, MRI, ultrasound, and radiography. Multimodal AI takes this sophistication to a new level. The incorporation of both clinical text and radiology images into multimodal models enables even more accurate predictions and expands the number of clinical use cases. Incorporation of multimodal imaging data sets is the next logical step. In this presentation, I will explore some of the latest developments in multimodal radiology AI with the goal to improve patient health.”

<!--		<strong> Abstract:</strong> Small molecule phenotypic screens test the effects of hundreds of thousands of compounds using miniaturized assays and automated image acquisition. These screens generate vast datasets that can be used to understand compounds’ mode of action and toxicity, characterize disease phenotypes, uncover new biology, and more. Image featurization is a prerequisite for the utilization of the data and self-supervised learning (SSL) is particularly suitable for this task given the scarcity of phenotypic annotations or biological labels. In this talk, I will show how we use SSL to extract image representations in small molecule discovery at Bayer AG. Our models provide powerful representations of plant phenotypes in herbicide screens as well as cellular phenotypes in Cell Painting data which outperform the commonly used software Cell Profiler. I will introduce examples of how image features can be leveraged in multiple applications, including phenotype clustering, mode of action identification, prediction of mitochondrial toxicity, and de novo molecular design with generative models among others.

<!--		<strong> Abstract:</strong>The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in precision medicine and decision support systems, particularly through the analysis of pathology images, holds immense potential to transform cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, implementing AI in computational pathology presents several challenges, including data heterogeneity, the need for large annotated datasets, huge compute costs, and the alignment between image tiles and whole slide information across multiple magnifications. To address these challenges, we propose a dual approach: (1) developing a family of large foundation models trained on millions of whole-slide images using self-supervised learning techniques to capture essential features and patterns across diverse pathology images; (2) pretraining an aggregator model that leverages vision and language through multimodal generative AI learning to incorporate clinical information typically reported in medical settings, thus enhancing the slide-level foundation model with richer contextual understanding. Our combined approach, developed through a collaboration between Paige and Microsoft, not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks but also demonstrates the generative AI’s potential to unlock new possibilities for next-generation computational pathology, promising more diverse applications and reduced development costs for better cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p>		-->

        	<strong> Abstract:</strong> In this talk I will discuss our work of a large-scale study of whole-brain neuron morphometry, analyzing 3.7 peta-voxels of mouse brain images at the single-cell resolution, producing one of the largest multi-morphometry databases of mammalian brains to date. We annotated 3D locations of cell bodies of over 182,000 neurons, modeled more than 15,000 dendritic microenvironments, characterized the full morphology of over 1,800 neurons along with their axonal motifs, and detected over 2.6 million axonal varicosities that indicate potential synaptic sites. Our analysis covers six levels of information related to neuronal populations, dendritic microenvironments, single-cell full morphology, sub-neuronal dendritic and axonal arborization, axonal varicosities , and sub-neuronal structural motifs, along with a quantification of the diversity and stereotypy of patterns at each level. Overall, our study provides an integrative description of key anatomical structures of neurons and their types, covering a wide range of scales and features, and contributes a large-scale resource to understanding neuronal diversity in the mammalian brain. With this dataset, we start to formulate a possible whole brain scale connectome at the single neuron resolution for mouse brains.

    		<strong> Abstract:</strong>The use of morphological profiles of cellular microscopy images is by now a widespread method of investigating the functional effects of perturbations and treatments on cellular models of disease, yet the insights gained from such analyses are only as good as the features extracted from these unstructured data. In this talk, I will describe how Recursion leveraged its phenomic datasets, computational resources, and a self-supervised learning objective to build Phenom-1, a foundation model of cellular morphology whose performance on downstream tasks like recall of known biological relationships appears to scale linearly in the logarithm of the total computational cost used to train it, a phenomenon known as the scaling hypothesis. A smaller version of this foundation model, called Phenom-Beta, was recently released under a non-commercial license on NVIDIA’s BioNemo platform. I will also briefly describe the role that foundation models like Phenom-1 play in a vision of the future of drug discovery, where AI agents generate and test hypotheses inferred from such models, and give a demo of LOWE, a first step towards this vision in which the cognitive capabilities of LLMs are leveraged to reason about and execute typical tasks involved in drug discovery: retrieval and analysis of data, design and execution of experiments, generation of compounds and prediction of their properties, etc.

		<strong> Abstract:</strong>As the smallest functioning living units, cells are key to understanding health and disease. To predict a patient’s responses to molecular drugs and design efficient treatments, it is vital to recover the underlying dynamics cells take upon administering a drug. Biologists have long sought to simulate the state and functioning of a cell in order to understand and control its core processes. In this talk, I will discuss how to use and design artificial intelligence tools combined with large biomedical datasets to infer such cellular behavior. I will cover our work on (diffusion and flow matching) generative models that robustly predict treatment responses of biopsied cells from metastatic melanoma patients. As integral part of an observational clinical cohort study, they are able to reveal otherwise hidden patterns of signaling pathway modulation associated with driver mutations and metastasis sites upon cancer treatments. Lastly, I will provide a perspective on how to develop biological foundation models and realize the vision of a virtual cell powered by artificial intelligence that will shape the future of treatment design and personalized therapies.</p>

		<strong> Abstract:</strong> By using microscopy images of cells to guide multiplexed spatial indexing of sequencing reads, Light-Seq allows combined imaging and spatially resolved next generation sequencing (NGS) measurements to be captured from fixed biological samples. This is achieved through the combination of spatially targeted, rapid photocrosslinking of DNA barcodes onto complementary DNAs in situ with a one-step DNA stitching reaction to create pooled, spatially indexed sequencing libraries. Selection of cells can be done manually by pointing and clicking on the regions of interest (ROIs) to be sequenced, or automatically through the use of computer vision for cell type identification and segmentation. This foundational capability opens up a broad range of applications for multi-omic analysis unifying microscopy and NGS measurements from intact biological samples.</p>

		<strong> Abstract:</strong> The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundational model trained on an extensive collection of images, presents many opportunities for diverse applications. For instance, we employed SAM in our biological pathway curation pipeline that synergizes image understanding and text mining techniques for deciphering gene relationships. SAM has proven highly efficient in recognizing pathway entities and their interconnections. However, SAM does not work well when applied to low-contrastive images directly. To counter this, we investigated prompt-based learning with SAM, specifically for identifying proteins from cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) images. We trained a U-Net-based filter to adapt these grayscale cryo-EM images into RGB images suitable for SAM's input. We also trained continuous prompts and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, even with a limited quantity of labeled data. The outcomes of our studies underscore the potential utilities of prompt-based learning on SAM for efficient biomedical image analyses.</p>
