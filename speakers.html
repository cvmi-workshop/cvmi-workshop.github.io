		<strong> Abstract:</strong> Cell images contain a vast amount of quantifiable information about the status of the cell: for example, whether it is diseased, whether it is responding to a drug treatment, or whether a pathway has been disrupted by a genetic mutation. We extract hundreds of features of cells from images. Just like transcriptional profiling, the similarities and differences in the patterns of extracted features reveal connections among diseases, drugs, and genes. Improving this pipeline is an active area of research, from feature extraction to batch correction to quality control to assessing similarities.

We are harvesting similarities in image-based profiles to identify, at a single-cell level, how diseases, drugs, and genes affect cells, which can uncover small molecules’ mechanism of action, discover gene functions, predict assay outcomes, discover disease-associated phenotypes, identify the functional impact of disease-associated alleles, and find novel therapeutic candidates. As part of the JUMP-Cell Painting Consortium (Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling-Cell Painting) we are aiming to establish experimental and computational best practices for image-based profiling (https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/results) and produce the world’s largest public Cell Painting gene/compound image resource, with 140,000 perturbations in five replicates, to be released November 2022. With these data and new technologies like Pooled Cell Painting and variants of the assay like LipocyteProfiler and CardioProfiler, we hope to bring drug discovery-accelerating applications to practice.

	<!--	<strong> Abstract:</strong> Methods for profiling RNA and protein expression in a spatially resolved manner are rapidly evolving, making it possible to comprehensively characterize cells and tissues in health and disease. The resulting large-scale and complex multimodal data sets raise interesting computational and machine learning challenges, from QC & storage to actual analysis. For instance what is the best description of a local cell neighborhood, how do we find such interesting ones and how are these differential across disease or other perturbations? And how can they be chained together to build a spatial human cell atlas?

Here, I will present approaches from the lab touching upon a few of these points. In particular, I will show how our recent toolbox Squidpy and the related SpatialData format support standard steps in analysis and visualization of spatial molecular data. I will then discuss recent approaches towards multimodal classification, learning cell cell communication and extension towards morphometric representations under perturbations using generative models.

		<strong> Abstract:</strong>The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in precision medicine and decision support systems, particularly through the analysis of pathology images, holds immense potential to transform cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, implementing AI in computational pathology presents several challenges, including data heterogeneity, the need for large annotated datasets, huge compute costs, and the alignment between image tiles and whole slide information across multiple magnifications. To address these challenges, we propose a dual approach: (1) developing a family of large foundation models trained on millions of whole-slide images using self-supervised learning techniques to capture essential features and patterns across diverse pathology images; (2) pretraining an aggregator model that leverages vision and language through multimodal generative AI learning to incorporate clinical information typically reported in medical settings, thus enhancing the slide-level foundation model with richer contextual understanding. Our combined approach, developed through a collaboration between Paige and Microsoft, not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks but also demonstrates the generative AI’s potential to unlock new possibilities for next-generation computational pathology, promising more diverse applications and reduced development costs for better cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p>

     	  	<strong> Abstract:</strong> Structural biologists around the world and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) played decisive roles in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. This talk will explain how global three-dimensional (3D) biostructure data was turned into global knowledge, allowing scientists and engineers around the world to understand the inner workings of coronaviruses and develop effective countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2. 

State-of-the-art mRNA vaccines, initially designed with guidance from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Spike Proteins, benefited more than five billion individuals around the world by preventing viral infections entirely or significantly reducing morbidity and mortality. Structure-guided drug discovery efforts at Pfizer, first initiated in the 2000s in response to the SARS-CoV epidemic and reactivated in 2020 early in the global pandemic, yielded nirmatrelvir -- a potent, orally-bioavailable, covalently-acting, peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease. This targeted antiviral drug received Emergency Use Authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration in December 2021, less than two years following public release of the viral genome sequence. It is used clinically for the treatment of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in a fixed dose combination with ritonavir and sold under the brand name Paxlovid. 

Bolstered by open access to research data generated with public and private monies, particularly 3D structures of coronavirus proteins archived in the PDB, basic and applied researchers made a difference when the world desperately needed them to succeed. To underscore the importance of these contributions, I quote Dr. Anthony Fauci, former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, “Show me a person who’s vaccinated, got infected, took Paxlovid and died. I can’t find anybody.”

   <!--     	<strong> Abstract:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is a complex and recalcitrant condition that has largely evaded traditional molecular drug discovery approaches. Phenotypic drug discovery using high-content cellular models with unbiased small molecule screening is promising but faces obstacles from subtle signal, artifacts, and non-specific visual markers. We propose two deep learning-based methods to overcome these challenges in large-scale cellular screens. First, we develop deep neural networks to generate missing fluorescence channel images from an Alzheimer's disease high-content screen (HCS), enabling the identification and prospective validation of overlooked but active small molecules. This is a unique application of generative images in drug discovery. Second, we introduce a learned biological landscape using deep metric learning to organize drug-like molecules by live-cell HCS images. Metric learning outperforms conventional image scoring and reveals previously hidden molecules that push diseased cells toward a healthy state as effectively as positive control compounds. These results indicate that a wealth of actionable biological information lies untapped but readily available in HCS datasets. -->

    		<strong> Abstract:</strong>The use of morphological profiles of cellular microscopy images is by now a widespread method of investigating the functional effects of perturbations and treatments on cellular models of disease, yet the insights gained from such analyses are only as good as the features extracted from these unstructured data. In this talk, I will describe how Recursion leveraged its phenomic datasets, computational resources, and a self-supervised learning objective to build Phenom-1, a foundation model of cellular morphology whose performance on downstream tasks like recall of known biological relationships appears to scale linearly in the logarithm of the total computational cost used to train it, a phenomenon known as the scaling hypothesis. A smaller version of this foundation model, called Phenom-Beta, was recently released under a non-commercial license on NVIDIA’s BioNemo platform. I will also briefly describe the role that foundation models like Phenom-1 play in a vision of the future of drug discovery, where AI agents generate and test hypotheses inferred from such models, and give a demo of LOWE, a first step towards this vision in which the cognitive capabilities of LLMs are leveraged to reason about and execute typical tasks involved in drug discovery: retrieval and analysis of data, design and execution of experiments, generation of compounds and prediction of their properties, etc.

<!--		<strong> Abstract:</strong>The lack of annotated publicly available medical images is a major barrier for innovations. At the same time, many de-identified images and much knowledge are shared by clinicians on public forums such as medical Twitter. Here we harness these crowd platforms to curate OpenPath, a large dataset of 208,414 pathology images paired with natural language descriptions. This is the largest public dataset for pathology images annotated with natural text. We demonstrate the value of this resource by developing PLIP, a multimodal AI with both image and text understanding, which is trained on OpenPath. PLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot and transfer learning performances for classifying new pathology images across diverse tasks. Moreover, PLIP enables users to retrieve similar cases by either image or natural language search, greatly facilitating knowledge sharing. Our approach demonstrates that publicly shared medical information is a tremendous resource that can be harnessed to advance biomedical AI.</p>

		<strong> Abstract:</strong> By using microscopy images of cells to guide multiplexed spatial indexing of sequencing reads, Light-Seq allows combined imaging and spatially resolved next generation sequencing (NGS) measurements to be captured from fixed biological samples. This is achieved through the combination of spatially targeted, rapid photocrosslinking of DNA barcodes onto complementary DNAs in situ with a one-step DNA stitching reaction to create pooled, spatially indexed sequencing libraries. Selection of cells can be done manually by pointing and clicking on the regions of interest (ROIs) to be sequenced, or automatically through the use of computer vision for cell type identification and segmentation. This foundational capability opens up a broad range of applications for multi-omic analysis unifying microscopy and NGS measurements from intact biological samples.</p>

		<strong> Abstract:</strong> The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundational model trained on an extensive collection of images, presents many opportunities for diverse applications. For instance, we employed SAM in our biological pathway curation pipeline that synergizes image understanding and text mining techniques for deciphering gene relationships. SAM has proven highly efficient in recognizing pathway entities and their interconnections. However, SAM does not work well when applied to low-contrastive images directly. To counter this, we investigated prompt-based learning with SAM, specifically for identifying proteins from cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) images. We trained a U-Net-based filter to adapt these grayscale cryo-EM images into RGB images suitable for SAM's input. We also trained continuous prompts and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, even with a limited quantity of labeled data. The outcomes of our studies underscore the potential utilities of prompt-based learning on SAM for efficient biomedical image analyses.</p>
